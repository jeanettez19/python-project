### Set Up
Tried running on python 3.11.2 which has Tkinter built in by default. Any version of python 3 should work.

### Running the program
Run the program by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # if you haven't installed the required packages
cd Assignment3(Python_Project) # navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located only works due to relative imports
python Main.py
```

### Compile
pip install pyinstaller
cd Assignment3(Python_Project)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
