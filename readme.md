### Set Up
Tried running on python 3.11.2 which has Tkinter built in by default. Any version of python 3 should work.

### Running the program
Run the program by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # if you haven't installed the required packages
python main.py
```
